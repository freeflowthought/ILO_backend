1. deploy HPOT.sol, 
    1.1 the congress will be `_msgSender()` temply
    1.2 the mint will be `_msgSender()` temply

2. deploy MintV1.sol using address of HPOT: constructor(IPRToken _token, uint256 _mintPerBlock, uint256 _startBlock)
    2.1 the developer will be `_msgSender()`, only developer can edit this field.
    2.2 the congress will be `_msgSender()` temply

3. you can change mint permit in HPOT to address of MintV1 now, operator account should be the same as `_msgSender()` before.

4. deploy AllocPointProposal.sol,
    4.1 the congress will be `_msgSender()` temply

5. deploy CongressV1.sol, using address of HPOT, MintV1 and AllocPointProposal, constructor(IPRToken _token, IMint _mint, IPProposal _allocPointProposal)
    5.1 the developer will be `_msgSender()`.
    5.2 the congress will be address(this) to show that no other can edit the `_permit` except itself. (In this int version, the developer can call the `updateCongress` func to set whole congress to a new one. This backdoor will dropped future, some Perpetual Proposal will instead.)

6. change congress permit for HPOT, MintV1 and AllocPointProposal to the address of CongressV1, operate by the account the same as `_msgSender()` before.


# Control flow is like following:

MintV1   <----  CongressV1  <---- // AllocPointProposal [TODO--]  
  |                 ｜
  ↓                 ｜
HPOT     <--------
